This application allows CRUD operations on Product, Order, Customer and Cart entities through requests to API endpoints.


A client can:
<br />
* Add a new customer 
* Delete a customer
* Edit information about a customer
* See all the customers
* Search a customer by id 

<br />

* See all the products and the products from a specific category
* Add a new product in the shop
* Delete a product from the shop
* Edit information about a product from the shop
* Search product by id

<br />

* Add an existing product from the shopping cart(with a specific quantity)
* Delete a product from the shopping cart
* Search a customer's cart by id

<br />

The main 5 features for the MVP would refer to the ability to add new customers, to visualize all the products, to add products in the shopping cart, to delete products from the cart and to place a new order.
